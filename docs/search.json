    "text": "1 Introduction\nGender equality is a more and more important issue these days. Whether men and women are treated equally in society is receives a wide discussion and one major way to contribute to it is doing exploratory research from historical data on gender difference. In this project, we will analyze gender difference in the field of Education, Employment and Health, through different countries and time. The main problem of this project include: Is there gender difference in employment, health and education data? If there is, how does this difference change in different countries? Besides, how does this difference change through history?",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nIn this project, we will use the data focused on 7 countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, United Kingdom and United States. There are four sources of data. For employment data, the source is International Labour Organization. “ILO modelled estimates database” ILOSTAT. https://ilostat.ilo.org/data/. The data is collected from the underlying household survey datasets (mostly labour force surveys) compiled by national statistical offices around the world. For health data, the source is United Nations Children’s Fund. “UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation”, https://childmortality.org/ The data is mainly collected from civil registration and surveys. For education data, the source is United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,“SDG Global and Thematic Indicators” https://uis.unesco.org/bdds. The data is collected from the respond of UIS questionnaires by national state authorities, usually the ministry of education or the national statistical office. Finally, for population data, the source is United Nations, “World Population Prospects”, https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/MostUsed/. It is collected through civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS) systems, population censuses, population registers and household surveys.All of these data are in csv format and updated annually. One issue related to these data, like population data and education data, is that it includes the estimate of data in the future, so the time exceed the current year, 2024. Since we are only making an exploratory analysis, not an estimate or model, so we exclude these data and limit the time from 2000 to 2024. ## Missing value analysis",
